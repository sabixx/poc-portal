# poc-portal
A status overview of all POCs





# TODO

- LINK productboard item is broken again for POC and use cases..

- show under use cases with the link if it's linked to some product board item.. probably just color the link item...

- ADD to the users a REGION so managers can filter by regions, not just by SEs... and later on AI will be able to filter..

- make sure feedback is shown... 

- make it possible to rotate API keys for the exposed API.

- desing a workflow behind the escalation... makeing it possible to track dicssuions or at least outcomes.. 

## Ideas

more statistics active POCs.... recently closed POCs...

- add an option to mark a POC as technical Win + Mark it if we also won it financially and they are now a customer.. \

- make notiifcations for SEs to review feedback.
- make a area where SEs can review their feedback from their POCs, and managers can see the feedback from all their SEs...

- notifiy via the browser if new feedback arrived, or a new use cases was markes as completed by a prospect

- change "How did you like this use case to 'Does the product address your needs, what could we improve?'" in the documentation..

- status update page on the POC doc container...

- product board...

- option to edit closed poc

- make a notification for customer feedback to review so when new feedback came it notifiy via a widget that there is feedback to review and make this to be ACKloedge by the SE and all managers that belong to this SE.. PM should see all feedback from all SEs as well see the "feedback to review".

Ses should have an option to ACK this feedback so it's makred as 'read' make something line moderns email clients... like if it's viewed for a few seconds make it read (actually read is better wording than ack).. and allow the SE to mark all feedback as read..




- STATISTICS / DASHBOARD options

  win/loss rate
  show use cases with most ERs
  show most demanded ERs


  Widgets:
  Active POCs (clickable)
  POCs in Review (clickable)
  Closed POCs (clickable)

  POCs at Risk
  

- enable to search in closed POCs.. that will probably take a while until this is necessary. hmm maybe it would make sense for Tony to find even active POCs faster... hmm


- AI QUESTIONS:

 how likley is it that we will win deal xzy?

 What have deals we win/loose in common?
 
 Is there a pattern if we win/loose deals
 
 Is there a difference between POCs in US and EMEA?

 Which Partners have the best/worst win rates

//// questions need to be not able to answer by regular sales tools like gong or salesforee...
